# From experiment to theory

 Biological or other physical networks can emerge from the growth of a population of growing apex by a combination of filament extension, orientation, branching and annihilation. High spatial and temporal resolution timelapses of such dynamics are currently being acquired by multiple teams across the world. These allow to track at the same time the behaviour of individual apex and the whole network formation.
 
How are these datasets being acquired? What data analysis tools can be put in place to analyse such complex dynamics? What kind of theoretical framework can help interpreting those results?

This  workshop aims at gathering international scientists that are involved in the acquisition, analysis or theoretical understanding of branching network growth. We believe the field is at a turning point and it is time for researcher to meet and share ideas, results and techniques.  


# Contact and informations

The workshop is organized by [Corentin Bisot](mailto:C.Bisot@amolf.nl) (AMOLF), [Thibault Chassereau](mailto:thibault.chassereau@u-paris.fr) (LIED), [Éric Herbert](mailto:eric.herbert@u-paris.fr) (LIED) and [Annemiek Cornelissen](mailto:annemiek.cornelissen@u-paris.fr (MSC).
