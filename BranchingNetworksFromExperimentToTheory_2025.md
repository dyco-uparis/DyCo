# From experiment to theory

 Biological or other physical networks can emerge from the growth of a population of growing apex by a combination of filament extension, orientation, branching and annihilation. High spatial and temporal resolution timelapses of such dynamics are currently being acquired by multiple teams across the world. These allow to track at the same time the behaviour of individual apex and the whole network formation.
 
How are these datasets being acquired? What data analysis tools can be put in place to analyse such complex dynamics? What kind of theoretical framework can help interpreting those results?

This  workshop aims at gathering international scientists that are involved in the acquisition, analysis or theoretical understanding of branching network growth. We believe the field is at a turning point and it is time for researcher to meet and share ideas, results and techniques.  


# Contact and informations

The workshop is organized by [Corentin Bisot](mailto:C.Bisot@amolf.nl) (AMOLF), [Thibault Chassereau](mailto:thibault.chassereau@u-paris.fr) (LIED), [Éric Herbert](mailto:eric.herbert@u-paris.fr) (LIED) and [Annemiek Cornelissen](mailto:annemiek.cornelissen@u-paris.fr) (MSC).

The workshop will take place over two days, on **26 and 27 June 2025**, on the Paris rive gauche campus of the **Université Paris Cité** (Paris 13). Presentations will take place in room 322 of the Lamarck building, 35 rue Hélène Brion, nearest  metro station  *Bibliothèque de France*, metro line 14.


# Program

**Day 1**  will be kicked off by discovering different experimental system and watching living (and maybe non living) systems grow : mosses, fungi, but also networked organs. How is this data acquired? How is it processed? In the afternoon we'll have our first set of group discussions as well as a "hands-on data" session. The question for the group discussion is still open and your ideas are most welcome. A potential question could be to explore commonalities and differences in morphogenesis among various systems, and how these might relate to functional similarities or differences. For the "hands-on data" session the idea was to let people with different analysis methods try them on each others' dataset, share ideas, practical problems etc...

<!--
The first day will be concluded by a lecture by Marc Barthelemy highlighting critical insights from spatial network theory, particularly relevant since all systems studied belong to this category. His talk will provide a strong theoretical foundation for subsequent discussions.
-->

In **day 2**, we'll indeed slowly move from timelapse datasets to theory and models. The day will open with a presentation by Stephane Douady on "ways", an underlying structure of spatial networks that inherits important informations about its growth. We'll then learn about different examples where network timelapses can be used to extract key growth parameters that are also important ecological traits. The afternoon will be started with a lecture on the modelling of branching networks. This will be followed by talks of modelers using similar frameworks to ask functional or optimality questions in network growth.
We already have an exciting program lined up. However, if you have collaborators or students whose work aligns closely with the themes of the workshop and who may wish to participate, please let us know. We may still accommodate additional talks or poster presentations.

Program will be updated with titles and abstracts.

In addition to the presentations, posters can be displayed in the room. Please use A0 format and vertical (portrait) orientation. We can take care of the printing. Please send an email to the organisers.
