# From experiment to theory

![*Podospora anserina* thallus growth](/images/Colloque-BranchingNetworks-OKweb.jpg){: width="500px"}

 Biological or other physical networks can emerge from the growth of a population of growing apex by a combination of filament extension, orientation, branching and annihilation. High spatial and temporal resolution timelapses of such dynamics are currently being acquired by multiple teams across the world. These allow to track at the same time the behaviour of individual apex and the whole network formation.
 
How are these datasets being acquired? What data analysis tools can be put in place to analyse such complex dynamics? What kind of theoretical framework can help interpreting those results?

This  workshop aims at gathering international scientists that are involved in the acquisition, analysis or theoretical understanding of branching network growth. We believe the field is at a turning point and it is time for researcher to meet and share ideas, results and techniques.

# Program


**Day 1** will be kicked off by **Tom Shimizu** and **Mark Fricker** giving an introductory duo talk presenting the history  of the study of growing networks in biology and the latest advancement in high throughput data acquisition. We will continue by discovering different experimental system and watching living (and maybe non living) systems grow : mosses, fungi, but also networked organs. How is this data acquired? How is it processed? The afternoon will start with a presentation by Marc Barthelemy on spatial network, the specific class of network that all our data belongs to. What general properties to these networks have? What can be considered a trait of a network and what is simply a consequence of spatial embedding? A first dive into theory.

In **day 2**, we’ll indeed slowly move from timelapse datasets to theory and models. The day will open with a presentation by **Stephane Douady** on “ways”, an underlying structure of spatial networks that inherits important informations about their growth. We’ll then learn about different examples where network timelapses can be used to extract key growth parameters that are also important ecological traits. The afternoon will be started by **Edouard Hannezo** presenting a general class of branching models that reproduces the dynamics of various systems. This will be followed by two presentations presenting variations around these models to answer ecologically relevant questions.

**Day 1**  will be kicked off by discovering different experimental system and watching living (and maybe non living) systems grow : mosses, fungi, but also networked organs. How is this data acquired? How is it processed? In the afternoon we'll have our first set of group discussions as well as a "hands-on data" session. The question for the group discussion is still open and your ideas are most welcome. A potential question could be to explore commonalities and differences in morphogenesis among various systems, and how these might relate to functional similarities or differences. For the "hands-on data" session the idea was to let people with different analysis methods try them on each others' dataset, share ideas, practical problems etc...


The first day will be concluded by a lecture by Marc Barthelemy highlighting critical insights from spatial network theory, particularly relevant since all systems studied belong to this category. His talk will provide a strong theoretical foundation for subsequent discussions.

**Testing the extreme plastic mycelium hypothesis: Does grazing induce developmental plasticity in saprotrophic fungi?**

Phenotypic plasticity—the ability of a genotype to alter its phenotype in response to environmental changes—can play a crucial role in maximizing fitness in fluctuating environments. However, plasticity comes at a cost, as the energy required to transform a phenotype imposes limits on its extent. While limits to plasticity are well-documented in many organisms, they are not well understood in modular organisms like filamentous fungi. Fungi have highly flexible morphologies, allowing individual organisms to adjust their phenotype in response to local environmental conditions. This flexibility has led to speculation that fungi exhibit "extreme phenotypic plasticity," making them an interesting system for studying plasticity mechanisms. To test this idea, we analyzed the grazer-induced morphological plasticity of four cord-forming fungal species exposed to different soil microfauna with varying feeding behaviors, using a phenotypic trajectory analysis framework. We hypothesized that grazing would drive convergence towards a common "grazing-resistant phenotype" across species, due to the extreme flexibility of fungal mycelia. Alternatively, we proposed that species would follow unique developmental trajectories in response to grazers, reflecting species-specific plasticity limits. Our results showed that fungal species accounted for most of the morphological variation, with grazers having only a small but significant effect. Moreover, we did not observe convergence towards a common grazing-resistant phenotype; instead, each species followed distinct developmental pathways within species-specific limits, which varied widely. Some species altered up to 30% of their phenotype in response to grazers, while others showed as little as 1% variation. These findings suggest a more nuanced view of fungal plasticity, where morphological plasticity might not be the most effective response to grazing pressure. We speculate that the observed differences in plasticity limits may correlate with the complexity of cord formation in different species. These constraints on fungal morphological plasticity offer new insights into how fungi adapt to dynamic ecological conditions and underscore the need to explore alternative phenotypic responses to environmental pressures. Our study highlights the need to refine plasticity theories, particularly for organisms with complex, modular structures like fungi.

**Invasion of epithelial layers by the fungal pathogen Candida albicans studied by live cell imaging and volum electron microscopy**

The opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans is normally commensal, residing in the mucosa of most healthy individuals. In susceptible hosts, its filamentous hyphal form can invade epithelial layers leading to superficial or severe systemic infection. We study the mechanisms of epithelial invasion and host damage in vitro using live cell imaging combined with real-time damage-sensitive reporters and three-dimensional volume electron microscopy.  We recently showed that C. albicans can invade successive epithelial cells without membrane breaching by inducing the formation of multi-layered host-membrane derived trans-cellular tunnels.

**Branching morphogenesis in moss filaments**

Branching forms are ubiquitous in nature and evolved repeatedly in the eukaryotic kingdom. In the evolution of plant body plans, the innovation of branching in filaments was likely a key step prior to the innovation of three-dimensional leafy shoots. In the life cycle of mosses, the first tissue that develops from spore germination are tip-growing, branched filaments. Using Physcomitrium patens as a model species, several molecular actors regulating branching morphogenesis in filaments have been identified. However, the mechanisms governing patterning at the macroscopic scale remain unclear. 
To address this gap, we developed a pipeline to acquire high-resolution 3D images of protonemal filaments in the first days of spore germination. Images were segmented and analyzed to extract the cell organization of filaments. Cell organization was formalized using mathematical trees, which enabled the quantitative analysis of branching patterns. 
Based on our observations, we propose that branching morphogenesis in P. patens filaments can be modeled using a simple probabilistic approach, in which subapical cells have a defined probability of producing a side-branch between each apical cell division. Additional rules can be integrated to account for specific observations, such as the absence of side-branch in the first subapical cells, or potential lateral inhibition mechanisms. This simple macroscopic model provides a cellular framework for future work investigating the role of underlying molecular mechanisms. 
Such simple macroscopic models can also provide a unifying theoretical framework to compare macroscopic rules driving development in different species, and identify the design principles driving branching morphogenesis in filamentous organisms across kingdoms.

**Study of the adaptative value of the root system architecture cost-performance tradeoff using Pareto optimality framework**

The root system is a critical organ to ensure the anchoring, water and nutrients uptake, and photo-assimilates transport, necessary for plant survival. To maintain these functions when exposed to environmental cues the root system altered its 3-dimensional organization in space, defined as the root system architecture (RSA)1. Depending on the environmental changes, one single genotype displays a variety of RSA to adapt accordingly, highlighting its plasticity. Therefore, the RSA plasticity is a key determinant driving plant survival and adaptation. In the context of climate change, the understanding of RSA plasticity is therefore crucial to uncover plant adaptation. The architectural plasticity can be assessed by changes of morphological (e.g. length), geometrical (e.g. depth), dynamical (e.g. growth rate), and topological descriptors. During the last half century, tremendous efforts were made to study those first three aspects due to their relatively easy assessment. Nonetheless, the analysis of RSA topology which consists of studying the efficiency and functions of a transport network remained underexplored notably by the requirements of computational analysis integrating several traits. In this talk, I will reveal how the efficiency of two root system functions, cost (growth) and performance (transport), limit the RSA plasticity finding a cost-performance tradeoff by a modeling approach based on Pareto optimality. Then, I will address how the climate change conditions that impact the root system functions decreasing water and nutrients accessibilities and promoting photo assimilates production modify the cost-performance tradeoff. Finally, I will present the experimental approaches to test the adaptative value of the root system architecture cost-performance tradeoff.

**Quantifying the impact of different forms of stress on fungal growth**

Using a stochastic growth-fragmentation process to model the growth of the mycelial network, we obtain explicit expressions for certain descriptors of fungal growth, which we can then use to infer growth parameters and quantify the impact of various forms of stress. This inference method uses the empirical distribution in length of terminal segments (portions of filament lying between an apex and a branching point) in the mycelium at some large time T and the growth rate of the total number of nodes to estimate the apical and lateral branching rates and the elongation speed. To assess the robustness of these estimates, we compare them to estimates obtained by tracking the dynamics of individual apexes in time and we also compare the experimental data to simulated data from the stochastic model using the estimated parameters.

**Influence of rock structure on the morphology of wormhole network**

Dissolution is a highly non-linear process in which the interplay of flow, transport, and reaction leads to the emergence of reaction-infiltration instabilities. In dissolving rocks at certain flow conditions, these instabilities give rise to the formation of a network of competing channels known as dissolution channels or wormholes. The wormholes compete for the available flow, with the winning wormhole attracting a larger flow and solute concentration, screening the rest of the network and forming a highly permeable conduit through the rock. In this study, we investigate how the rock structure, such as packed layers of low porosity, can influence the shape of evolving dissolution channels. We analyze the shape of experimentally formed wormhole networks in two different types of limestone using geometric measures that account for tortuosity and branching. These measures indicate that wormholes formed perpendicular to the packed layers are more tortuous and contain more branches compared to those formed along the packed layer in higher porosity regions. We verify these observations by analyzing the pore architecture of the respective samples, obtained from microtomography scans

**Stochastic models of multicellular branching morphogenesis**

Branching morphogenesis is a prototypical example of complex three-dimensional organ sculpting, required in multiple developmental settings to maximize the area of exchange surfaces. It requires, in particular, the coordinated growth of different cell types together with complex patterning to lead to robust macroscopic outputs. In recent years, novel multiscale quantitative biology approaches, together with biophysical modelling, have begun to shed new light of this topic. I will discuss some of these recent developments, highlighting the generic design principles that can be abstracted across different branched organs, as well as the implications for the broader fields of stem cell, developmental and systems biology.

**Growth and structure of underground fungal networks**

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMFs) form symbiotic relationships with the roots of most terrestrial plants, playing a crucial role in nutrient exchange and ecosystem stability. In these organisms, network structure directly impacts functions such as transport efficiency, spatial exploration, and robustness. Yet, network formation is constrained by finite resources, forcing trade-offs between competing functional goals. Some species evolve structures optimized for exploration, others for resilience or efficiency. To investigate these trade-offs, we introduce a minimal spatial model of AMF network growth, based on just three local rules: hyphal growth, branching, and fusion (anastomosis). Despite its simplicity, the model generates a wide range of morphologies and reveals general principles applicable to other biological and artificial systems that self-organize through decentralized, resource-limited dynamics.

**Simulation of hyphal network growth and transport**

Bioenergy crops like switchgrass benefit from their associations with mycorrhizal fungi, filamentous branching colonies that retrieve nutrients and water from the surrounding soil in exchange for plant carbon, though the partnership is dependent on the environmental context and the particular species pairing. Through imaging of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colony growth, we have observed diverse morphologies among a collection of species. We are interested in how hyphal network architecture and dynamics might influence the plant-fungi resource economy, and whether we might predict which species pairs would thrive in a particular environment. We developed the Plant-Hyphosphere Resource Economy Emulator (PHREE) to simulate the growth of hyphal colonies and their nutrient return-on-carbon-investment with plants under different environmental conditions. By parameterizing simulations with high-resolution imaging, we are able to re-capture the morphology and growth of several AMF species and identify environmental optima for plant fitness. I will discuss the model design, preliminary results and identify some areas for improvement.
