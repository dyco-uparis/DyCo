title: Colloque Branching networks. From experiment to theory
---

 Biological or other physical networks can emerge from the growth of a population of growing apex by a combination of filament extension, orientation, branching and annihilation. High spatial and temporal resolution timelapses of such dynamics are currently being acquired by multiple teams across the world. These allow to track at the same time the behaviour of individual apex and the whole network formation.
 
How are these datasets being acquired? What data analysis tools can be put in place to analyse such complex dynamics? What kind of theoretical framework can help interpreting those results?

This  workshop aims at gathering international scientists that are involved in the acquisition, analysis or theoretical understanding of branching network growth. We believe the field is at a turning point and it is time for researcher to meet and share ideas, results and techniques.  

The conference will take place over two days, on 26 and 27 June 2025, on the Paris rive gauche campus of the Université Paris Cité (Paris 13). Presentations will take place in room 326 of the Lamarck building (35 rue H. Brion).
