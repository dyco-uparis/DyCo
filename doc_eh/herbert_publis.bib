	abstract = {The metabolic processes complexity is at the heart of energy conversion in living organisms and forms a huge obstacle to develop tractable thermodynamic metabolism models. By raising our analysis to a higher level of abstraction, we develop a compact—i.e. relying on a reduced set of parameters—thermodynamic model of metabolism, in order to analyse the chemical-to-mechanical energy conversion under muscle load, and give a thermodynamic ground to Hill’s seminal muscular operational response model. Living organisms are viewed as dynamical systems experiencing a feedback loop in the sense that they can be considered as thermodynamic systems subjected to mixed boundary conditions, coupling both potentials and fluxes. Starting from a rigorous derivation of generalized thermoelastic and transport coefficients, leading to the definition of a metabolic figure of merit, we establish the expression of the chemical-mechanical coupling, and specify the nature of the dissipative mechanism and the so-called figure of merit. The particular nature of the boundary conditions of such a system reveals the presence of a feedback resistance, representing an active parameter, which is crucial for the proper interpretation of the muscle response under effort in the framework of Hill’s model. We also develop an exergy analysis of the so-called maximum power principle, here understood as a particular configuration of an out-of-equilibrium system, with no supplemental extremal principle involved.},

	abstract = {• Xylem cavitation in plants is thought to be caused by a loss of adhesion at the conduit wall surface because a rupture in the body of the water column was implicitly ruled out by an experiment by Lyman J. Briggs with Z-tube capillaries. However, Briggs reported a drastic increase in cavitation pressure of water below 5°C which, if it were also true in xylem conduits, would suggest that water transport in plants could be limited by water cohesion at low temperature. • In this study we have repeated Briggs’ experiment using stem segments. Xylem vulnerability curves were obtained with a centrifuge technique at 1, 25 and 50°C on yew (Taxus baccata). • Contrary to Briggs’ finding, vulnerability to cavitation, measured as per cent loss conductance, did not increase sharply at 1°C and was even less than at 25°C and 50°C. Moreover, the onset of cavitation in yew at 1°C was measured at a much more negative pressure than Briggs’ value. • This points out an artefact in Brigg's experiment at low temperature possibly related to imperfections in the tube walls which act as cavitation nuclei.},

The temperature dependence of this quantity is of special interest for water, where it can be used as a probe of a postulated anomaly of its equation of state. After a brief review of previous experiments on cavitation, we describe our method which consists in focusing a high amplitude sound wave in the bulk liquid, away from any walls. We obtain highly reproducible results, allowing us to study in detail the statistics of cavitation, and to give an accurate definition of the cavitation threshold. Two independent pressure calibrations are performed. The cavitation pressure is found to increase monotonically from −26MPa at 0°C to −17MPa at 80°C. While these values lie among the most negative pressures reported in water, they are still far away from the cavitation pressure expected theoretically and reached in the experiment by Angell and his group [Zheng et al., Science 254, 829 (1991)] (around −120MPa at 40°C). Possible reasons for this discrepancy are considered.},

	abstract = {An aberration correction method based on the maximization of the wave intensity at the focus of an emitting array is presented. The potential of this new adaptive focusing technique is investigated for ultrasonic focusing in biological tissues. The acoustic intensity is maximized noninvasively through direct measurement or indirect estimation of the beam energy at the focus for a series of spatially coded emissions. For ultrasonic waves, the acoustic energy at the desired focus can be indirectly estimated from the local displacements induced in tissues by the ultrasonic radiation force of the beam. Based on the measurement of these displacements, this method allows determination of the precise estimation of the phase and amplitude aberrations, and consequently the correction of aberrations along the beam travel path. The proof of concept is first performed experimentally using a large therapeutic array with strong electronic phase aberrations (up to 2pi). Displacements induced by the ultrasonic radiation force at the desired focus are indirectly estimated using the time shift of backscattered echoes recorded on the array. The phase estimation is deduced accurately using a direct inversion algorithm which reduces the standard deviation of the phase distribution from sigma = 1.89 radian before correction to sigma = 0.53 radian following correction. The corrected beam focusing quality is verified using a needle hydrophone. The peak intensity obtained through the aberrator is found to be -7.69 dB below the reference intensity obtained without any aberration. Using the phase correction, a sharp focus is restored through the aberrator with a relative peak intensity of -0.89 dB. The technique is tested experimentally using a linear transmit/receive array through a real aberrating layer. The array is used to automatically correct its beam quality, as it both generates the radiation force with coded excitations and indirectly estimates the acoustic intensity at the focus with speckle tracking. This technique could have important implications in the field of high-intensity focused ultrasound even in complex configurations such as transcranial, transcostal, or deep seated organs.},

The number of branches depends on the power injected within the waves. The measurement of the nonlinear dispersion relation is found to be well described by a law suggesting that the energy transfer mechanisms involved in wave turbulence are restricted not only to purely resonant interaction between nonlinear waves.

	abstract = {Using time series of stereoscopic particle image velocimetry data, we study the response of a turbulent von Kármán swirling flow to a continuous breaking of its forcing symmetry. Experiments are carried over a wide Reynolds number range, from the laminar regime at Re = 102 to the highly turbulent regime near Re = 106. We show that the flow symmetry can be quantitatively characterized by two scalars, the global angular momentum I and the mixing layer altitude zs, which are shown to be statistically equivalent. Furthermore, we report that the flow response to small forcing asymmetry is linear, with a slope depending on the Reynolds number: this response coefficient increases non-monotonically from small to large Reynolds number and presents a divergence at a critical Reynolds number Rec = 40 000 ± 5000. This divergence coincides with a change in the statistical properties of the instantaneous flow symmetry I(t): its pdf changes from Gaussian to non-Gaussian with multiple maxima, revealing metastable non-symmetrical states. For symmetric forcing, a peak of fluctuations of I(t) is also observed at Rec: these fluctuations correspond to time intermittencies between metastable states of the flow which, contrary to the very-long-time-averaged mean flow, spontaneously and dynamically break the system symmetry. We show that these observations can be interpreted in terms of divergence of the susceptibility to symmetry breaking, revealing the existence of a phase transition. An analogy with the ferromagnetic–paramagnetic transition in solid-state physics is presented and discussed.},

This study is motivated by the sizable discrepancy between the acoustic cavitation threshold measured in water and the value predicted by CNT. We find that the same discrepancy is present for heavy water, whereas the agreement is better for ethanol and heptane and intermediate in the case of dimethyl sulfoxide. It is well-known that water is an anomalous liquid, a consequence of its hydrogen-bonded network. The other liquids studied represent very different molecular interactions. Our results indicate that the cavitation threshold approaches the prediction of CNT as the surface tension gets smaller. Conversely, this raises the question of the validity of a simple theory such as CNT to account for high surface tension liquids and suggests that an appropriate microscopic model of such liquids may be necessary to correctly predict the cavitation threshold.},

Our macroscopical measurements indicate no noticeable difference between classical and superfluid flows, thereby providing evidence of the same dissipation scaling laws in the two phases. A detailed study of the evolution of the hysteresis cycle with the Reynolds number supports the idea that the stability of the steady states of classical turbulence in this closed flow is partly governed by the dissipative scales. It also supports the idea that the normal and the superfluid components at these temperatures (1.6 K) are locked down to the dissipative length scale.},

Such analysis goes well beyond the analysis of the mean flow and of the fluctuations and links the behavior of the recorded time series to a discrete version of a stochastic differential equation which is able to describe the correlation structure in the dataset. We introduce a new index Υ that measures the difference between the resulting analysis and the Obukhov model of turbulence, the simplest stochastic model reproducing both Richardson law and the Kolmogorov spectrum. We test the method on datasets measured in a von Kármán swirling flow experiment. We found that the ARMA analysis is well correlated with spatial structures of the flow, and can discriminate between two different flows with comparable mean velocities, obtained by changing the forcing. Moreover, we show that the Υ is highest in regions where shear layer vortices are present, thereby establishing a link between deviations from the Kolmogorov model and coherent structures. These deviations are consistent with the ones observed by computing the Hurst exponents for the same time series. We show that some salient features of the analysis are preserved when considering global instead of local observables. Finally, we analyze flow configurations with multistability features where the ARMA technique is efficient in discriminating different stability branches of the system.},

	abstract = {The notion of instability of a turbulent flow is introduced in the case of a von Kármán flow thanks to the monitoring of the spatio-temporal spectrum of the velocity fluctuations, combined with projection onto suitable Beltrami modes. It is shown that the large scale coherent fluctuations of the flow obey a sequence of Eckhaus instabilities when the Reynolds number Re is varied from 102 to 106. This sequence results in modulations of increasing azimuthal wavenumber. The basic state is the laminar or time-averaged flow at an arbitrary Re, which is axi-symmetric, i.e., with a 0 azimuthal wavenumber. Increasing Re leads to non-axisymmetric modulations with increasing azimuthal wavenumber from 1 to 3. These modulations are found to rotate in the azimuthal direction. However, no clear rotation frequency can be established until Re ≈ 4 × 103. Above, they become periodic with an increasing frequency. We finally show that these modulations are connected with the coherent structures of the mixing shear layer. The implication of these findings for the turbulence parametrization is discussed. Especially, they may explain why simple eddy viscosity models are able to capture complex turbulent flow dynamics.},

We first argue that the coherent steady states may be described as the equilibrium states of well-chosen lattice models, which can be used to define global properties of von Kármán flows, such as their temperatures. The equilibrium description is then enlarged, in order to reinterpret a series of results about the stability of those steady states and their susceptibility to symmetry breaking, in the light of a deep analogy with the statistical theory of ferro-magnetism.},

	abstract = {We present the closed-loop approach to linear nonequilibrium thermodynamics considering a generic heat engine dissipatively connected to two temperature baths. The system is usually quite generally characterized by two parameters: the output power P and the conversion efficiency η, to which we add a third one, the working frequency ω. We establish that a detailed understanding of the effects of the dissipative coupling on the energy conversion process requires only knowing two quantities: the system's feedback factor β and its open-loop gain A0, which product A0β characterizes the interplay between the efficiency, the output power, and the operating rate of the system. By raising the abstract hermodynamic analysis to a higher level, the feedback loop approach provides a versatile and economical, hence fairly efficient, tool for the study of any conversion engine operation for which a feedback factor can be defined.},

	abstract = {The resuspension and dispersion of particles occur in industrial fluid dynamic processes as well as environmental and geophysical situations. In this paper, we experimentally investigate the ability to fluidize a granular bed with a vertical gradient of temperature. Using laboratory experiments with a localized heat source, we observe a large entrainment of particles into the fluid volume beyond a threshold temperature. The buoyancy-driven fluidized bed then leads to the transport of solid particles through the generation of particle-laden plumes. We show that the destabilization process is driven by the thermal conductivity inside the granular bed and demonstrate that the threshold temperature depends on the thickness of the granular bed and the buoyancy number, i.e., the ratio of the stabilizing density contrast to the destabilizing thermal density contrast.},

	abstract = {The Podospora anserina genome contains a large family of 15 multicopper oxidases (MCOs), including three genes encoding a FET3-like protein, an ABR1-like protein and an ascorbate oxidase (AO)-like protein. FET3, ABR1 and AO1 are involved in global laccase-like activity since deletion of the relevant genes led to a decrease of activity when laccase substrate (ABTS) was used as substrate. However, contrary to the P. anserina MCO proteins previously characterized, none of these three MCOs seemed to be involved in lignocellulose degradation and in resistance to phenolic compounds and oxidative stress. We showed that the bulk of ferroxidase activity was clearly due to ABR1, and only in minor part to FET3, although ABR1 does not contain all the residues typical of FET3 proteins. Moreover, we showed that ABR1, related to the Aspergillus fumigatus ABR1 protein, was clearly and specifically involved in pigmentation of ascospores. Surprisingly, phenotypes were more severe in mutants lacking both abr1 and ao1. Deletion of the ao1 gene led to an almost total loss of AO activity. No direct involvement of AO1 in fungal developmental process in P. anserina was evidenced, except in a abr1Δ background. Overall, unlike other previously characterized MCOs, we thus evidence a clear involvement of ABR1 protein in fungal development.},

The flow is produced between two counter-rotating or co-rotating disks. The large size of the experiment allows exploration of ultra high Reynolds numbers based on Taylor microscale and rms velocity [S. B. Pope, Turbulent Flows (Cambridge University Press, 2000)] (Rλ {\textgreater} 10000) or resolution of the dissipative scale for lower Re. This article presents the design and first performance of this apparatus. Measurements carried out in the first runs of the facility address the global flow behavior: calorimetric measurement of the dissipation, torque and velocity measurements on the two turbines. Moreover first local measurements (micro-Pitot, hot wire,…) have been installed and are presented.},
