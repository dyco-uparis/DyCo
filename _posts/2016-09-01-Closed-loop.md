### Abstract

We present the closed-loop approach to linear nonequilibrium thermodynamics considering a generic heat
engine dissipatively connected to two temperature baths. The system is usually quite generally characterized by
two parameters: the output power P and the conversion efficiency $$\eta $$, to which we add a third one, the working
frequency $$\omega $$. We establish that a detailed understanding of the effects of the dissipative coupling on the energy
conversion process requires only knowing two quantities: the system’s feedback factor $$\beta$$ and its open-loop gain
$$A_0$$ , which product $$A_0 \beta$$ characterizes the interplay between the efficiency, the output power, and the operating
rate of the system. By raising the abstract hermodynamic analysis to a higher level, the feedback loop approach
provides a versatile and economical, hence fairly efficient, tool for the study of any conversion engine operation
for which a feedback factor can be defined.
