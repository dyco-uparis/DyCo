# Growing and Branching Network

Apex–Hypha Interaction.
The growth of filamentous fungal hyphae is polarized. In the vicinity of a pre-existing hypha, the growing tip exhibits either avoidance or attraction behavior. 
Based on reconstructed data of thallus growth in a filamentous fungus, this project aims to characterize the nature and dynamics of these interactions.

# Out-of-Equilibrium Thermodynamics

1. Muscle is an energy-converting machine that can be described using Onsager's classical Force–Flux formalism.
We propose to extend this framework in two main directions:

    The current model applies only to stationary states. Building upon the time-dependent coupling matrices introduced by Zwanzig, we aim to describe transient phases of muscular acceleration.

    The model is currently validated from the fiber to the organismal scale, yet the fundamental mechanism of muscle contraction lies at the molecular level. We therefore propose to extend the description to molecular scales using a ratchet-based model.

2. At the organismal level, energy fluxes during exertion can be assessed through measurements of mechanical power output and oxygen consumption. Using a swim tunnel available in the laboratory, we plan to compare two subpopulations of the small piranha Astyanax mexicanus, which display markedly distinct phenotypes: one active and fast, the other calm and slow. The objective is to characterize and compare their physiologies in light of derived thermodynamic observables.

# Energy Conversion and Socio-Metabolic Modeling

Living systems are characterized by a minimal energy consumption rate — the basal metabolism. This consumption is constrained by a single energy source that must simultaneously support use, maintenance, and structural synthesis, unlike engineered systems, which rely on distinct power sources for each function.
Here, we aim to explore and model the concept of basal metabolism in living systems. Specifically, we will investigate the ratio of energy fluxes between basal and active processes — such as reproduction, structure formation, or locomotion — in both photosynthetic organisms and animals, as well as the formation of local energy stocks that buffer demand. These analyses will allow for a quantitative comparison with engineered energy-conversion systems.
