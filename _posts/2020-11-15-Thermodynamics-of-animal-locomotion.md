title: 'Thermodynamics of animal locomotion'
---

This paper is a foundation of thermodynamics of animal locomotion. It builds on previous paper that discussed the *metabolic behaviour* ([here](_posts/2019-02-01-Thermodynamics-of-metabolic-energy-conversion-under-muscle-load)) of living system and the notion of *adaptability* for living organism ([here](_posts/2020-01-01-Adapted-or-Adaptable.md))

### Abstract

Muscles are biological generators of mechanical power. They have been extensively studied in the frame of Hill's classic empirical model as isolated biomechanical entities, which hardly applies to a living body subjected to internal and environmental constraints. Here we elucidate the overarching principle of a \emph{living} muscle action for a specific purpose such as locomotion, considering it as an assembly of chemical-to-mechanical energy converters (muscle units) connected in parallel, under mixed boundary conditions. Introducing the energy cost of effort, COE−, as the generalization of the well-known oxygen cost of transport, COT, in the frame of our compact locally linear non-equilibrium thermodynamics model, we analyze oxygen consumption measurement data from a documented experiment on energy cost management and optimization by horses moving at three different gaits. Horses adapt to a particular gait by mobilizing a nearly constant number of muscle units minimizing waste production per unit distance covered; this number significantly changes during transition between gaits. The mechanical function of the animal is therefore determined both by its own thermodynamic characteristics and by the metabolic operating point of the system.
