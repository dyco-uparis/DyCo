#### Master internship

We propose a master internship at the interface of physics and biology, supervised by biologist and
physicist, to study the adaptation of the power production mechanism of
animals to the environment.

#### Power production

The power production mechanism, for example dedicated to locomotion, is a general and vital process
based in the animal world on the degradation of ATP molecules during the
Krebs cycle. However, this common process, far from freezing the
modalities of use and power production of living systems, adapts to the
specific environmental constraints encountered by each population.

More specifically, we are interested, in a biomimetic approach, in the
**adaptive optimisation of energy conversion systems according to the
constraints imposed on access to resources.**

To this end, we are developing a theoretical and experimental approach,
deriving the well-known formalism of **non-equilibrium thermodynamics**
to living systems and relying on the description of **biological
mechanisms of metabolism**, and in particular oxygen consumption. This
allows us to reconstruct the energy flows through the organism and to
characterise it quantitatively using generic parameters allowing
inter-individual comparison.

Although our approach has so far focused mainly on mammalian species (in
particular the horse, see ref below), the development of simple
metabolic characterisation tools allows us to consider broadening the
range of species studied. Following preliminary work carried out in the
laboratory, we have designed a device (swimming tube and sensors) to
record the consumption of dioxygen of actinopterygian fish. In order to
limit the effects due to genetic variability, we propose to compare
morphotypes of the same species. We have chosen *Astyanax mexicanus*, a
species in which there are two separate but interbreeding populations: a
surface morphotype, a predator with a very vivacious behaviour, and a
cavernicolous morphotype, a detritivore with a placid behaviour. In
addition, we propose to conduct a phylogenetic analysis that will allow
us to describe the evolution of biological processes that determine the
ability to produce and sustain effort in all vertebrate animals; and, in
particular, to characterise the evolution of mechanisms of adaptation to
effort during the transition from aquatic to terrestrial life in the
vertebrate lineage as a bioinspired model of adaptive transition.
